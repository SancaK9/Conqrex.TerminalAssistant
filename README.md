## Features

### Command Management
- **Customizable Commands**: Store frequently used terminal commands with custom labels and descriptions
- **Command Organization**: Group commands in a hierarchical structure with nested groups (e.g., "Development/Frontend/React")
- **Parameterized Commands**: Define dynamic parameters using {parameter} syntax with descriptions and default values
- **Execution Modes**: Choose between auto-execute (run immediately) or manual execute (just insert the command)

### User Interface
- **Modern Sidebar View**: Access all commands from the dedicated Terminal Assistant panel in VS Code
- **Hierarchical Display**: Commands are organized in collapsible groups and subgroups
- **Visual Command Editor**: Create and edit commands with an intuitive form interface
- **Contextual Actions**: Quick actions for running, editing, and removing commands

### Storage Options
- **Workspace Storage**: Keep commands specific to individual projects
- **Global Storage**: Share commands across all your workspaces
- **Easy Toggling**: Switch between storage locations with a simple command

### Search and Access
- **Powerful Search**: Find commands by name, description, command text, or group
- **Command Palette Integration**: Access commands from VS Code's command palette
- **Group Filtering**: Quickly filter commands by their group or subgroup

### Parameter Support
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Automatically prompts for parameter values when running commands
- **Default Values**: Define default values for parameters to speed up execution
- **Parameter Descriptions**: Add helpful descriptions to make parameters more user-friendly

### Command-Specific Keyboard Shortcuts
You can now assign keyboard shortcuts to individual terminal commands:

1. When creating or editing a command, use the "Keyboard Shortcut" field
2. Either type your desired shortcut or click "Record Keys" to capture keystrokes
3. Save the command and the shortcut will be registered automatically

This allows you to execute your most frequently used commands with a quick keystroke, without even opening the Terminal Assistant panel.

**Note:** If a shortcut conflicts with an existing VS Code keybinding, the Terminal Assistant shortcut may not work. Choose unique combinations to avoid conflicts.
