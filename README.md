## Features

### Modern Command Interface
- **Visual Command Browser**: Browse your commands in a sleek, collapsible tree view with icons
- **Interactive Actions**: Run, edit, or delete commands directly from the interface
- **Group Management**: Automatically organize commands in expandable/collapsible groups
- **Rich Command Display**: See command descriptions, groups, and execution details at a glance
- **Panel View Option**: Access your commands from both the activity bar or a minimized panel view

### Command Management
- **Customizable Commands**: Store frequently used terminal commands with custom labels and descriptions
- **Command Organization**: Group commands in a hierarchical structure with nested groups (e.g., "Development/Frontend/React")
- **Parameterized Commands**: Define dynamic parameters using {parameter} syntax with descriptions and default values
- **Execution Modes**: Choose between auto-execute (run immediately) or manual execute (just insert the command)
- **Quick Pick Command**: Access your commands quickly with Ctrl+Shift+A (Cmd+Shift+A on Mac)

### Terminal Handling
- **Smart Terminal Mode**: Choose how terminals are handled when executing commands:
  - Reuse existing terminals (default)
  - Always create new terminals
  - Smart reuse based on terminal state
- **Task Terminal Behavior**: Configure how commands interact with read-only task terminals
- **Auto-close Task Prompts**: Automatically dismiss "press any key to close" prompts

### Enhanced Search Experience
- **Instant Search**: Filter commands as you type with real-time results
- **Full-text Search**: Find commands by name, description, command text, or group
- **Visual Feedback**: Clearly see which commands match your search criteria
- **Search Persistence**: Search state is preserved when switching between views

### Storage Options
- **Workspace Storage**: Keep commands specific to individual projects
- **Global Storage**: Share commands across all your workspaces
- **Easy Toggling**: Switch between storage locations with a simple command

### Command-Specific Keyboard Shortcuts
You can now assign keyboard shortcuts to individual terminal commands:

1. When creating or editing a command, use the "Keyboard Shortcut" field
2. Either type your desired shortcut or click "Record Keys" to capture keystrokes
3. Save the command and the shortcut will be registered automatically

This allows you to execute your most frequently used commands with a quick keystroke, without even opening the Terminal Assistant panel.

**Note:** If a shortcut conflicts with an existing VS Code keybinding, the Terminal Assistant shortcut may not work. Choose unique combinations to avoid conflicts.

### Parameter Support
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Automatically prompts for parameter values when running commands
- **Default Values**: Define default values for parameters to speed up execution
- **Parameter Descriptions**: Add helpful descriptions to make parameters more user-friendly

## Command Editor
The Terminal Assistant provides an intuitive command editor for creating and configuring your terminal commands.

### Managing Storage Location
- Use the command "Terminal Assistant: Toggle Command Storage Location" to switch between workspace and global storage

Terminal Assistant provides several configuration options to customize your experience:

- **Storage Location**: Choose where commands are stored (workspace or global)
- **Task Terminal Behavior**: Configure how to handle commands when a read-only task terminal is active
- **Auto Close Task Prompts**: Automatically dismiss terminal prompts
- **Terminal Mode**: Control how terminals are created and reused when executing commands

Access these settings through VS Code's Settings UI or settings.json file.

## Example Use Cases
- Running complex build scripts with different configuration parameters

- Executing database operations with different targets
- Running test suites with various filters and flags
- Creating standardized Git commit messages with parameters
- Any repetitive terminal tasks that require slight variations
